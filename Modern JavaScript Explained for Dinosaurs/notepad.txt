 How to connect index.html with index.js?
 <script src="index.js"></script>


 What moment.js library do?
 It is a library which can help format dates in a human readable way


 How we use moment function in index.js?
 first we have to install file http://momentjs.com/ and then copy and paste on moment.min.js file and then we can use moment function in index.js
 we can add moment.js to our website by downloading the moment.min.js file in the same directory and including it in our index.html file.
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
  <script src="moment.min.js"></script>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from HTML!</h1>
</body>
</html>
 
// index.js
  console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
  console.log(moment().startOf('day').fromNow());



Why we write <script src="moment.min.js"></script> before <script src="index.js"></script>?
moment.min.js gets loaded before index.js, which means you can use the moment function in index.js 


What is npm?
It is a package manager made specifically for node.js, a JavaScript runtime designed to run on the server, not the frontend. 


How to check node is installed in your computer?
node -v


What is package.json file and How we can create?
This is a configuration file that npm uses to save all project information. 
we can create this by writing on terminal npm init


$ npm install moment --save What does this command do?
This command does two things — first, it downloads all the code from the moment.js package 
into a folder called node_modules. Second, it automatically modifies the package.json file
 to keep track of moment.js as a project dependency.


 When sharing a project with others what we share node_modules or package.json?
when sharing a project with others — instead of sharing the node_modules folder 
(which can get very large), you only need to share the package.json file and other
 developers can install the required packages automatically with the command npm install.


 What we use to download and update moment.js file?
 no longer have to manually download moment.js from the website, 
 we can automatically download and update it using npm.


Looking inside the node_modules folder, we can see the moment.min.js
file in the node_modules/moment/min directory. This means we can link
to the npm downloaded version of moment.min.js in the index.html file
What is good things and bad things happen?
The good thing is that we can now use npm to download and update our
packages through the command line.
The bad thing is we inconviently digging around this node modulus folder
That's not how it means to be used. The node_modulus folder is made to just
download the file automatically and u should be able to link to it automatically
without having to manually type out the entire path.
